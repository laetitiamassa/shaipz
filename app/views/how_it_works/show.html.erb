			<h2>How it works?</h2>

			<h3>Step 1 – the project : think BIG</h3>
			<p><b>Instead of</b> looking for your <b>appartement, search for the whole building</b> where you would like to buy an appartment. Once you’ve found your dream building, create a project on Shaipz around that building, and complete the détails of that project.</p>

			<h3>Step 2 – the people : find them and collaborate</h3>
			<p>Once you've created your project, share it on Shaipz.com and in your social networks, so that <b>people with similar or complementary tastes can join!</b></p>
			<p>Once you have reached the minimum required people for the project (for the number of available appartments you see or imagine in it), <b>discover each other with the participants, visit the building altogether and start collaborating</b> in order to achieve the group sale of the building and <b>define your own internal terms</b> (for example : a common garden, garage or spare room, an extension, ...).</p>

			<h3>Step 3 – the offline sale : make it happen</h3>
			<p>Together with your co-buyers,  you can negotiate the sale with the seller, in order to (1) <b>get your global price offer accepted by the seller</b>, (2) then <b>divide the building</b> in several appartments according to your internal terms, and (3) finally <b>sign the notarial sales deed</b> recognizing the number of different appartments you defined (this might sometimes be subject to administrative authorizations).</p>
			<p>This way, <b>each member of the “buying group” buys, from day one, his/her own appartment</b>, in a building whose people and internal terms he/she previously knows and agreed on!</p>
