  FAQ:
    faq_extended: "Frequently asked questions"
    question-what: "What is Shaipz?"
    answer-what: "Shaipz is a web application which helps you to connect to home-buyers with a similar real estate profile as yours, and to collaborate with them so that each of you, buys his/her own apartement in the same building."
    question-for-whom: "Is Shaipz suitable for my needs?"
    answer-for-whom: "Shaipz is the right solution for you if you want to (i) buy an apartment, (ii) make economies of scale doing it, (iii) meet your future neighbours before investing in your apartment, or (iv) if you want to create an alternative housing project (cohousing project, kanguru housing, participative housing, ...). If besides all that, you are ready to collaborate in order to reach your real estate goal, Shaipz is definitely the right path for you!"
    question-how: "How does Shaipz work?"
    answer-how: "Shaipz works around concrete projects, created and managed by its users. Each project is based on a building for sale, and composed of several participants among which the project's leader, as well as of a succession of events organized by the participants as they want (from the visit of the building to the offer to the seller, through internal meetings,...)."
    question-doityourself: "Why do the participants manage their projects?"
    answer-doityourself: "One of the reasons why the apartments' prices are so high is the number of intermediaries (real estate agents, developers, ...) between the seller and the buyers of flats in the same building. At Shaipz, we believe that, when the participants take steps to realize their real estate objectives themselves, not only they save money (generally from around 5% to 20%), but they also happen to build a tailor-made project that really fit their needs."
    question-howmanyprojects: "How many projects can I create and join?"
    answer-howmanyprojects: "You can create and join as many projects as you want on Shaipz."
    question-agency: "Is Shaipz a real estate agency?"
    answer-agency: "No. Shaipz do not play any role of intermediary within the transaction between seller and buyers.  Shaipz is a connection and collaboration tool at the service of buyers sharing and pursuing a complementary real estate dream."
    question-howsave: "How does Shaipz help me save money?"
    answer-howsave: "Shaipz lets you group up with each other to achieve economies of scale: the price per square meter of apartment decreases depending on its surface. The larger the bought surface is, the lower the price per square meter stands. For example, a 50m2 apartment costs 150,000 euros, while the price of the entire building (3 rental units of 50m2) of 150m2, is 300,000 euros. The price of each of the three flats is here of 100 000 euros instead of 150 000 euros. So should you group up in advance to buy your flat in this building, each of the participants would save 50,000 euros."
    question-legal: "Legally speaking, will my ownership be joint with the other buyers?"
    answer-legal: "No. The Shaipz concept provides for the separation of the buyers's future properties BEFORE the purchase of their respective apartments. Thus, following the authentic act of purchase, you become, directly and separately, the full owner of your apartment, as if you had bought it the conventional way."
    question-bank: "Is it possible to obtain an individual loan from the bank?"
    answer-bank: "Yes. We provide Shaipz users who subscribe to this service, with legal documents and recommendations which include arguments to best address your banker."
    question-howsteps: "What is the frame of a project on Shaipz?"
    answer-howsteps: "A project on Shaipz is typically divided into three main phases: 1. The discovery of the building and of the participants (your potential future neighbors) 2. The commitment of the participants interested in pursuing the project, towards themselves first (preliminary agreement), and vis-à-vis the seller then (offer to buy) 3. The various legal and administrative paperwork to bring the project to life (expertise, if required planning permission, deeds, ...)."
    question-howmuch: "How much cost the Shaipz's use and services?"
    answer-howmuch: "Signing up for Shaipz is free, as well as creating and participating to as many projects as you wish. Legal recommendations and documents allowing you to benefit from the concept Shaipz is a premium service for which you can get more information and a fee quote "

    how: "How does Shaipz work?"
    how-intro: "Shaipz works around three main aspects: the people, the buildings and the events"
    how-content1: "On Shaipz, each user has a real estate profile, including his/her name, budget, favorite districts, minimum space wanted, as well as his/her buying personal status, his/her openness to cohousing, and of course his/her 3 best moments for a visit or a meeting with potential futur neighbours."
    how-content2: "Besides the users, there are the projects. Based upon a divided or dividable building, each project is created or lead by a Shaipz user like you, and soon joined by other Shaipz users interested in buying one of the appartements available in the building."
    how-content3: "Once there are enough participants having joined the project, a visit of the building or a meeting between participants takes place. If the participants want to pursue with the building of the project, they follow the key successive steps to achieve the purchase, by each of them, of his/her own appartment in the building."

    affordable: "How does Shaipz help me save money?"

    affordable-content1: "Shaipz enable people looking for a flat to go for the wholesale real estate market (appartments-block buildings and multi-family homes for sale), and not for the retail real estate market (one signle appartment for sale). Buying an appartement for sale as a unit instead of buying, with others, a divided or divisible appartment-block building, costs proportionally more on a price/m2 basis."
    affordable-content2: "Not convinced? Make a little experiment: on the one hand search for a flat, and on the other hand for an appartments-block building in the same neighbourhood. Divide the price by the space in each case. Note the difference. Whicht one is proportionnally the cheapest?"

      vision_content1: "Unlike the epitome "
      vision_content2: "'Location, location, location'"
      vision_content3: ", here at Shaipz we believe that the primary criteria in the choice of our next home, is actually 'the people, the people, the people'."
      vision_content4: "Indeed, when we choose our futur neighbourhood, simply observing the location (as the surrounding facilities) is loosing sight of the fact that "
      vision_content4bis: "what will affect us the most on an daily-basis, it's our direct environment: our neighbours."
      vision_content5: "Getting the chance to meet them before making the leap is therefore essential."
      vision_title2: "Poorly housed generation"
      vision_content6: "Time fixes things, except real estate prices."
      vision_content7: "Since our parents' generation, the price of real estate, both to buy and rent, has been steadily climbing."
      vision_content8: "A a result, today, even with a decent salary, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to house themselves properly in the neighborhood of their choice."
      vision_content9: "When doing the calculation, considering the price of rent, it is generally cheaper to buy an apartment that we occupy rather than rent it."
      vision_content10: "Yes, except that the purchase price of a first apartment (nothing extravagant: a small single-bedroom flat of 60m2) has become increasingly unaffordable for first-time buyers. And in fact, the average price per square meter of this type of apartment is generally higher (yes, the smaller, the more expensive). "
      vision_content11: "Here at Shaipz, we believe that, in the same way "
      vision_content11bis: "as flatsharing"
      vision_content11ter: " is a brilliant idea to rent a decent apartment in a neighborhood that we like, "
      vision_content11quater: "collaborative purchase is the best way to access to home-ownership."
      vision_title3: "Collaboration is empowering"
      vision_content12: "Let's get back to our example of the small apartment of 60m2, which is proportionally more expensive than a larger apartment."
      vision_content13: "Why more expensive? Due to the market: the segment of 60m2 apartments is one of those that meet the highest demand from acquirers."
      vision_content14: "Increased competition between buyers gives more power to the seller, contributing greatly to the surge in prices."
      vision_content15: "Here at Shaipz, we believe that "
      vision_content15bis: "instead of being competitors for the same apartment, the acquirers should become partners"
      vision_content15ter: ": work together to get out of this very expensive segment of the market and move together toward the whole building containing these so popular apartments. "
      vision_content16: "In short, collaboration empowers acquirers, by enabling them to go on a market segment where the buyer has more power in the transaction. "
