  FAQ:
    faq_extended: "Frequently asked questions"
    question-what: "What is Shaipz?"
    answer-what: "Shaipz is a web application which helps you to connect to home-buyers with a similar real estate profile as yours, and to collaborate with them so that each of you, buys his/her own apartement in the same building."
    question-for-whom: "Is Shaipz suitable for my needs?"
    answer-for-whom: "Shaipz is the right solution for you if you want to (i) buy an apartment, (ii) make economies of scale doing it, (iii) meet your future neighbours before investing in your apartment, or (iv) if you want to create an alternative housing project (cohousing project, kanguru housing, participative housing, ...). If besides all that, you are ready to collaborate in order to reach your real estate goal, Shaipz is definitely the right path for you!"
    question-how: "How does Shaipz work?"
    answer-how: "Shaipz works around concrete projects, created and managed by its users. Each project is based on a building for sale, and composed of several participants among which the project's leader, as well as of a succession of events organized by the participants as they want (from the visit of the building to the offer to the seller, through internal meetings,...)."
    question-doityourself: "Why do the participants manage their projects?"
    answer-doityourself: "One of the reasons why the apartments' prices are so high is the number of intermediaries (real estate agents, developers, ...) between the seller and the buyers of flats in the same building. At Shaipz, we believe that, when the participants take steps to realize their real estate objectives themselves, not only they save money (generally from around 5% to 20%), but they also happen to build a tailor-made project that really fit their needs."
    question-howmanyprojects: "How many projects can I create and join?"
    answer-howmanyprojects: "You can create and join as many projects as you want on Shaipz."
    question-agency: "Is Shaipz a real estate agency?"
    answer-agency: "No. Shaipz do not play any role of intermediary within the transaction between seller and buyers.  Shaipz is a connection and collaboration tool at the service of buyers sharing and pursuing a complementary real estate dream."
    question-howsave: "How does Shaipz help me save money?"
    answer-howsave: "Shaipz lets you group up with each other to achieve economies of scale: the price per square meter of apartment decreases depending on its surface. The larger the bought surface is, the lower the price per square meter stands. For example, a 50m2 apartment costs 150,000 euros, while the price of the entire building (3 rental units of 50m2) of 150m2, is 300,000 euros. The price of each of the three flats is here of 100 000 euros instead of 150 000 euros. So should you group up in advance to buy your flat in this building, each of the participants would save 50,000 euros."
    question-legal: "Legally speaking, will my ownership be joint with the other buyers?"
    answer-legal: "No. The Shaipz concept provides for the separation of the buyers's future properties BEFORE the purchase of their respective apartments. Thus, following the authentic act of purchase, you become, directly and separately, the full owner of your apartment, as if you had bought it the conventional way."

    question-howsteps: "What is the frame of a project on Shaipz?"
    answer-howsteps: "A project on Shaipz is typically divided into three main phases: 1. The discovery of the building and of the participants (your potential future neighbors) 2. The commitment of the participants interested in pursuing the project, towards themselves first (preliminary agreement), and vis-à-vis the seller then (offer to buy) 3. The various legal and administrative paperwork to bring the project to life (expertise, if required planning permission, deeds, ...)."
    question-howmuch: "How much cost the Shaipz's use and services?"

    affordable-content1: "Shaipz enable people looking for a flat to go for the wholesale real estate market (appartments-block buildings and multi-family homes for sale), and not for the retail real estate market (one signle appartment for sale). Buying an appartement for sale as a unit instead of buying, with others, a divided or divisible appartment-block building, costs proportionally more on a price/m2 basis."
    affordable-content2: "Not convinced? Make a little experiment: on the one hand search for a flat, and on the other hand for an appartments-block building in the same neighbourhood. Divide the price by the space in each case. Note the difference. Whicht one is proportionnally the cheapest?"
